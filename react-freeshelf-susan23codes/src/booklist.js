    "detailedDescription": "It’s easy to learn parts of JavaScript, but much harder to learn it completely—or even sufficiently—whether you’re new to the language or have used it for years. With the 'You Don’t Know JS' book series, you’ll get a more complete understanding of JavaScript, including trickier parts of the language that many experienced JavaScript programmers simply avoid. The series’ first book, Up & Going, provides the necessary background for those of you with limited programming experience. By learning the basic building blocks of programming, as well as JavaScript’s core mechanisms, you’ll be prepared to dive into the other, more in-depth books in the series—and be well on your way toward true JavaScript."

    "detailedDescription": "The intent of this book is to help you, the beginning designer, by giving you a sequence of interesting and moderately complex exercises in OO design. The exercises are not focused on a language, but on a design process. The exercises are not hypothetical, but must lead directly to working programs. This book can also help managers develop a level of comfort with the process of OO software development. This book allows the reader to explore the processes and artifacts of OO design before project deadlines make good design seem impossible."

So called because of the wizard on the jacket. One of the bibles of the LISP/Scheme world. Also, less commonly, known as the Purple Book.",
    "coverImageUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ebooks/6276830/6276830.jpg",
    "publisher": "The MIT Press",
    "publicationDate": "1984",
    "detailedDescription": "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs has had a dramatic impact on computer science curricula over the past decade. This long-awaited revision contains changes throughout the text. There are new implementations of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at MIT since the first edition was published. A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises. In addition, all the programs have been reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres to the IEEE standard."
